## Work in Progress

Hi, I’m **Andre** — a **3rd Year IT student** preparing for internships and entry-level roles.  
I focus on building strong fundamentals in **development, networking, cybersecurity, and IT operations** through hands-on labs, projects, and documentation.

I prioritize **learning by doing**. Each repository includes notes, screenshots, and clear READMEs to show both process and results.

## Pinned Projects

My pinned repositories contain:
- Labs and learning notes  
- Small but complete projects  
- Clear documentation with screenshots  
- Continuous updates as my skills improve

These projects reflect my progress across development, networking, and cybersecurity foundations.
